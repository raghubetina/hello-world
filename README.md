# Friendbook

In this project, we'll create our very first HTML page; a profile of ourselves. We're going to start with [a text-only page that looks like this](http://thin.npr.org/), and then evolve it with some styles to look [something like this](http://www.npr.org/).

## Setup

 1. Type `bin/setup` in a Terminal and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.
 1. Press the green "Run Project" button at the top of the window to start the server.
 1. Press the "Preview" button at the top of the window to see the running application.

## Structure with HTML

### Raw Content

We'll start by getting the raw content into the page, and ignore styling for now.

 1. Create a file in the `public/` folder called `index.html`.
 1. To honor an ancient tradition, first type `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`. From the File menu, Save. Then refresh the Preview. Congratulations â€” your very first web page!
 1. Type in your own content:
  - Your name
  - Where you're from
  - Some of your prior experience (jobs, education)

### Add Semantic Markup

Next, let's tag our content to let the browser know what each thing is. Useful HTML elements include:

 - Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ... , `<h6>`
 - Paragraph: `<p>`
 - Unordered list: `<ul>`
 - Ordered list: `<ol>`
 - List item: `<li>`
 - Link: `<a href="http://www.addressofsomepage.com/whatever">`

### Add Images

Let's add some images to the page. You can grab them from [Stock Up](http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up)) if you like.

Then, add them into your document using the `img` tag:

```html
<img src="/whatever.jpg">
```

Or, if it's located somewhere out on the internet rather than in our own `public/` folder:

```html
<img src="http://www.somewhere.com/whatever.jpg">
```

### Tables

Let's put your experience data into a table. In HTML, the `<table>` element is used to represent two dimensional data. A simple table looks like this:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>First</td>
    <td>Last</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

which would produce this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>First</td>
    <td>Last</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The things to keep in mind about tables are:

 - Every piece of data must reside within a cell, a `<td>` (table data) element.
 - Every `<td>` element must reside within a row, a `<tr>` element.
 - Every `<tr>` must have the same number of cells, or things get out of whack.

Despite this last rule, you can, however, "merge" cells using the `colspan` attribute:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">People</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

produces:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">People</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can see that we've merged two cells in the first row together; the `colspan="2"` on the first cell ensures that we don't violate the "every `<tr>` must have the same number of cells" rule.

**Your task:** Try to create a "What I've Done" section similar to [the one you see here](http://appdevspring16.github.io/friendbook/intermediate.html).

### Embedding Objects

 - Add a Google Map of your favorite nearby haunt
 - Add a YouTube video that you like

## Styling with CSS

Now that we have our content showing up, and we've added some basic structure with HTML, it's time to customize the styling of the page.

The basic syntax of CSS looks like this:

```html
<h1 class="greeting">Hi there</h1>

<style>
  .greeting {
    font-size: 24px;
    color: darkgrey;
  }
</style>
```

The rest is just practice, and expanding our vocabulary of what CSS properties are available to us.

Below are some resources that might be helpful as we go along:

 - Hero unit with cover image:

```css
.top-cover {
  background: url("cover.jpg") no-repeat center bottom;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 300px;
}
```

- [Material-Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)-style box shadow:

```css
.some-thing {
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24);
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.some-thing:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}
```
